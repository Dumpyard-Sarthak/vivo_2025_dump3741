#1. Below are the four tags for blacklist
#   A. Address_Based   C. Manufacturer_based
#   B. Name_Based      D. Vndr_Prdt_Based
#   E. SSR_Max_Lat_Based F: Version_Based
##
#   A. Address_Based :  This tag refers to Address based blacklist
#   Input Type       :   Input value should be only 3 to 6 bytes of BD address
#   Format Type      :   Address should be in XX:XX:XX format
#   Examples         :   00:01:03 = Address_Based
###
#   B. Name_Based :   This tag refers to Name based blacklist.
#   Input type    :   Input should be only string and length of the string
#                     should not be more than 248 characters.
#   Format Type   :   string
#   Examples      :   Sample Headset name = Name_Based
####
#   C. Manufacturer_Based :  This tag refers to Manufacturer based blacklist
#   Input type  : Input should be in Hexadecimal Number of Manufacturer
#   Format Type : 2 Bytes Hexadecimal Value
#   Examples    : 0X0023 = Manufacturer_Based
#####
#   D. Vndr_Prdt_Based : This tag refers to vendor and product based blacklist
#   Input type  : Input should be in Hexadecimal value
#   Format Type : 4 bytes hex value( 2 bytes of vendor  and 2 bytes of product),
#                 Vendor and product hex values should be separated with delimiter(-).
#   Examples    : 0X00AB-0X00BC = Vndr_Prdt_Based
#####
#   E. SSR_Max_Lat_Based : This tag refers to SSR Max Latency based blacklist
#   Input type  : Input value should be combination of first 3 bytes of BD address and
#                 Hexadecimal value of SSR Max Latency
#   Format Type : Address should be in XX:XX:XX format followed by 2 bytes hex value
#                 of max latency Address and Max Latency should be separated with delimiter(-).
#   Examples    : 00:01:03-0X00AB = SSR_Max_Lat_Based
#####
#   F. Version_Based : This tag refers to DID Version based blacklist
#   Input type  : Input value should be Hexadecimal value
#   Format Type : 2 bytes hex value
#   Examples    : 0X00AB = Version_Based
